# Phishing in Style: Microsoft Sway abused to deliver Quishing attacks

In July 2024, Netskope Threat Labs tracked a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to phishing pages delivered through Microsoft Sway. The majority of the credential grabbing pages investigated used “Quishing,” a form of phishing that uses QR code to trick users into accessing a malicious website. The phishing campaigns targeted MS Office credentials, using documents to bait users into logging in. The campaigns have targeted victims mainly in Asia and North America across multiple segments led by Technology, Manufacturing, and Finance.
