# Yokai

Yokai is a DLL Backdoor that has been around since atleast 2024. It is written in C++ and offers console access to the threat actor for executing shell commands. Known variants communicate with the C2 over port 80 or 443, and the data is encrypted using a custom XOR-based algorithm. Yokai is known to be deployed through DLL side-loading by legitimate executables.
