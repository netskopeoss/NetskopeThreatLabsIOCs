# DCRat

DCRat (also known as Dark Crystal RAT) is a modular remote access Trojan (RAT) which is offered as malware-as-a-service (MaaS) and has been around since 2018. It is written in C# and has typical RAT and information stealing capabilities, such as executing shell commands, logging keystrokes, exfiltrating files and credentials, among others. DCRat has historically been delivered through compromised or fake websites, HTML smuggling, password-protected archives delivered through popular media such as Signal, Cobalt Strike Beacons, or email spam with macro-embedded Excel or PDF attachments.
