# Evil Ant Ransomware

Evil Ant ransomware is a python-based malware that looks to encrypt files and backup files. It extorts payment from its victim in the form of bitcoin. While the files are encrypted, it is important for victims to avoid shutting down or restarting your computer to avoid corrupting the files.
