### Script

Netskope Threat Labs is releasing a small script to help to patch the ROP calls used by the Play Ransomware. The script input is the malware payload and the output is the payload with all the ROP calls removed and properly patched, making the disassembly view way easier to follow. 

The following is an example of the script output:

```text
python3 play_ransomware_rop_fixer.py mw.exe

[+] INFO: Starting analysis of mw.exe
[+] INFO: Searching ROP calls...
[+] INFO: Found 163 ROP calls
[+] INFO: Patching file...
[+] INFO: New file saved as mw.exe_patched
```

We're also releasing a script to generate the 8-byte key used by the malware string deobfuscation algorithm as well as a script to simulate the string deobfuscation operations.
