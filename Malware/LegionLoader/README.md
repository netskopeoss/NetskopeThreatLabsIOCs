# LegionLoader

Starting February 2025, Netskope Threat Labs has tracked and reported a couple of phishing and malware campaigns targeting victims searching for PDF documents on search engines. 
Attackers employ fake CAPTCHA to direct these victims to malicious websites. 
While tracking these threats, we discovered a malicious campaign that also utilizes similar tactics, this time is used to distribute LegionLoader and eventually used to install a malicious browser extension.
