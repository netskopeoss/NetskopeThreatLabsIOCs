# Latrodectus

Latrodectus is a downloader first discovered by Walmart back in October of 2023. The malware became very famous due to its similarities with the famous IcedID malware, not only in the code itself but also the infrastructure, as previously reported by Proofpoint and Team Cymru S2. The malware is usually delivered via email spam campaigns conducted by two specific threat actors: TA577 and TA578. Among the several features it contains is the ability of downloading additional payloads to be executed, collect and send system information to the C2, terminate processes, and more.
